### Hi, I am Aniket ðŸ‘»

Selftaught Software developer passionate about **opensource**, **systems programming** and **full stack web development**. I want to show the world that age and degrees don't count as the necessity to software development, hence *17 year old trying to change the world through code*. I love coding in **rust**, **js/ts**, **c++/c**, **java** (only if it is necessary, bcz gc ðŸ¤¢).

**Frontend**

I preffer plain **JS/TS** for small projects but **svelte** or **react** for larger projects. Currently I am experimenting with **wasm(rust)**

**Backend**

Defaulting to **NodeJS**, I use **serverless lambda(AWS)** functions accompanied with **dynamodb** as the backbone of my projects. To keep the cost as low as possible I developed [FireJSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firejsx) which enables me to **SSR** my page on events such as an article push to a blog site and then pipe it to a **S3** bucket which acts as a https server. Hence doing task only when required, thus keeping costs low. I preffer using **rust** for performance critical tasks.

For complex websites I'll preffer using an **ec2 instance**(full featured server) accompanied with **MongoDB**/**PostgreSQL**, where rust or java acts as the server software sitting behind **nginx reverse proxy**

**Systems Programming**

Systems programming is the field which keeps me motivated about software development, because I am eagre to learn and the more I learn about systems the more I realise of how less I know. I finally moved from **C/C++** to **Rust**, using [FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html) whenever necessary. 

**vcs of choice** : git > github

**desktop os of choice** : linux > arch

**server os of choice** : linux > debian > ubuntu

I want to talk more about stuff like [NIO in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/package-summary.html), JavaFX, OpenGl/Vulkan/Qt/GTK+, Embedded Systems and more but it is already getting very lengthy. Invite me for a coffee and we'll discuss more.

Btw, check out my other profile [eAdded](https://github.com/eadded) as well.
