### Hi, I am Aniket ðŸ‘»

Selftaught Software developer passionate about **opensource**, **systems programming** and **full stack web development**. I want to show the world that age and degrees don't count as the necessity to software development, hence *17 year old trying to change the world through code*. I love coding in **rust**, **js/ts**, **c++/c**, **java** (only if it is necessary, bcz gc ðŸ¤¢).


**Frontend**

I preffer plain **JS/TS** for small projects but **svelte** or **react** for larger projects. Currently I am experimenting with **wasm(rust)**

**Backend**

Defaulting to **NodeJS**, I use **serverless lambda(AWS)** functions accompanied with **dynamodb** as the backbone of my projects. To keep the cost as low as possible I developed [FireJSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firejsx) that enables me to **SSR** my page on events such as a new article in a blog site and pipe it to a **S3** bucket which acts as a https server. Hence doing task only when required, keeping cost low. I preffer using **rust** for performance critical tasks.

**vcs of choice** : git > github

**desktop os of choice** : linux > arch

**server os of choice** : linux > debin > ubuntu

**Journey**

Java (Awt, Javafx) instantiated my developer journey on Summer 2013. I created a password manager and spent half a year designing a trash UI first in awt, then in javafx. Spent a couple more weeks designing the encryption algorithm only to realise that AES can already do the job for me. This project taught me tons of concepts about graphics, memory management, multi threading, io, fd,

From 2013-Current I have created tons of projects
