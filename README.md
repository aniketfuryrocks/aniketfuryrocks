### Hi, I am Aniket

Selftaught Software developer passionate about **opensource**, **systems programming** and **full stack web development**. I want to show the world that age and degrees don't count as the necessity to software development, hence *18 year old trying to change the world through code*. I code in **rust**, **js/ts**, **c/c++**, **java/javafx**, **html/css**, **go**, **dart/flutter**.

**Frontend**

I prefer plain **JS/TS** for small projects but **svelte** or **react** for larger projects. Currently, I am experimenting with **wasm(rust)**

**Backend**

Defaulting to **NodeJS**, I use **serverless lambda(AWS)** functions accompanied with **dynamodb** as the backbone of my projects. To keep the cost as low as possible I developed [FireJSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firejsx) which enables me to **SSR** my page on events such as an article push to a blog site and then pipe it to an **S3** bucket which acts as an HTTPS server. Hence doing tasks only when required, thus keeping costs low. I prefer using **rust** for performance-critical tasks.

For complex websites I'll prefer using an **ec2 instance**(full-featured server) accompanied with **MongoDB**/**PostgreSQL**, where rust or java acts as the server software sitting behind **Nginx reverse proxy**

**Systems Programming**

Systems programming is the field that keeps me motivated about software development because I am eager to learn, and the more I learn about systems the more I realize how little I know. I finally moved from **C/C++** to **Rust**, using [FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html) whenever necessary. 

**Android**

Though it's been a long time, since I have touched android development as I hate its choice of java and inefficient stack, yet I look forward to do some progress in it to increase my knowledge base. I created [UniversalShare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eadded.universalshare&hl=en_US) which implements my multi-thread asynchronous HTTP server. I plan to create a framework to ease the development of desktop, web, android, and ios apps sharing one codebase using rust. 

**vcs of choice** : git > github

**desktop os of choice** : linux > arch

**server os of choice** : linux > debian > ubuntu

I want to talk about stuff like [NIO in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/package-summary.html), JavaFX, OpenGL/Vulkan/Qt/GTK+, Embedded Systems, and more but it is already getting very lengthy. Invite me for a coffee and we'll discuss more.

Btw, check out my other profile [eAdded](https://github.com/eadded) too.
