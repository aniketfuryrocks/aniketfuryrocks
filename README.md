### Hi, I am Aniket ðŸ‘»

Software developer passionate about **opensource**, **systems programming** and **full stack web development**. I want to show the world that age and degrees don't count as the necessity to software development, hence *17 year old trying to change the world through code*. I love coding in **rust**, **js/ts**, **c++/c**, **java** (only if it is necessary, bcz gc ðŸ¤¢).

**Journey**

Java (Awt, Javafx) instantiated my developer journey on Summer 2013. I created a password manager and spent half a year designing a trash UI first in awt, then in javafx. Spent a couple more weeks designing the encryption algorithm only to realise that AES can already do the job for me. This project taught me tons of concepts about graphics, memory management, multi threading, io, fd,

From 2013-Current I have created tons of projects
